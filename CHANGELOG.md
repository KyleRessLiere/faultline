# Changelog

## Battles as data

- `.fight` text format: terrain and placement share one grid, so a board is what it looks like and
  authors never count coordinates. Documented in FIGHT_FORMAT.md.
- `FightParser` — string in, `FightParseResult` out. No file IO, so Core stays droppable into Unity
  and the parser is testable from a literal.
- Issues split by code range: **errors** (`FightIssueCode` 0–99) mean the file cannot become a fight
  and it is skipped; **lints** (100+) mean it breaks a layout guideline from Brief §2 but loads and
  plays exactly as written. Codes are stable so tests never match on prose.
- `FightLibrary` reads the `.fight` files embedded in Core, in filename order, keeping failures
  visible; `All()` returns the playable ones sorted by `number:`. Adding a fight is adding a file —
  no registration, no code change.
- Fight 1 moved out of hard-coded C# into `Fights/Data/first-contact.fight`, unchanged in content.
- Fights 2–5 authored as data: The Teeth, Broken Bridge, High Road, The Maw. Kill All only —
  objectives, the boss and between-fight upgrades are still M6, and the shell still opens on fight 1.

## M2 — Displacement

- `Displacement`: step-by-step Push and Pull resolved against each tile entered — collision with
  walls, edges, ledges and units (2 to each party), spikes (3 and stop), pits (Clinging), and the
  1-damage fall off HighGround that lets the displacement continue.
- Stagger: collision and spike damage stagger; the next displacement gains +1 and consumes it.
- Anchor Push resistance, Wardbearer Hold, and Footing, applied in the order Brief §4 pins down.
- Clinging, rescue (whole activation), kicking a clinging enemy off (free action), and Voided.
- `Displacement.Preview` — the push preview CLAUDE.md requires, produced by the same simulation
  `Resolve` executes so the two cannot disagree.
- Class abilities: Bull Rush, Stagger Shot, Reel, and the passive Hold, with `AbilityDescriptor`
  carrying name, rules text, range and damage so the shell writes no rules text of its own.
- Basic attacks gained their M2 halves: the Vanguard shoves 1, the Threadcaster may pull 1 instead
  of dealing damage.
- Shell: an action bar of ability buttons showing effect and damage, range tinting, projected-path
  highlighting, and a plain-language hover preview of the outcome — all read from Core queries.
- Hand-drawn SVG silhouettes replace the two-letter unit labels; status pips for clinging,
  staggered and spent Footing.
- 151 tests green.

### Not in M2

Enemy AI and intents (M3), the collapse clock (M4), Momentum accounting and commander cards (M5),
fights 2–5 (M6). Player-side Footing is a rule without a prompt until M3 (DECISIONS.md D-017).

## M1 — Rules skeleton

- Solution scaffolded: `Faultline.Core` (netstandard2.1, BCL only), `Faultline.Web` (Blazor WASM),
  `Faultline.Core.Tests` (xUnit).
- Repo retargeted from the initial Unity scaffolding to .NET per AGENT_BRIEF.md (DECISIONS.md D-001).
- Core primitives: `Coord`, `Direction`, `UnitId`, `TileType`, immutable `Board`, `BoardLayout` string-art parser.
- Units: `UnitKind`, `UnitTemplate` stat tables for all four classes and all five enemies, immutable `Unit`.
- State: `GameState`, `Phase`, `FightOutcome`, structural equality on `Board` and `GameState`.
- Command/event vocabulary and the `Apply(state, cmd) → StepResult` contract.
- `IRng` / `SeededRng` — deterministic integer-only xorshift32, state carried in `GameState`.
- Fight 1 ("Kill All") authored as data: 7×7 layout, opposite-corner deployment zones, four enemy spawns.
- Rules: alternating deployment, the PlayerA→Enemy→PlayerB→Enemy activation loop, round advance,
  movement with terrain costs and canonical pathing, basic attacks with the HighGround bonus,
  voluntary spike damage, downing, and Kill All win/lose.
- Blazor shell: grid render, unit selection, legal-move and attack highlighting, hotseat deployment
  and activation, event log. Reads every legality question out of `StepResult.LegalNext`.
- 97 tests green, including a seed + command-log replay assertion.

### Not in M1

Displacement, Clinging, Stagger, Footing, enemy AI, intents, the collapse clock, Momentum accounting,
commander cards, fights 2–5. Enemy activation slots exist but pass (DECISIONS.md D-013).
